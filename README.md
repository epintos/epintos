### Hola! I'm Esteban 👋 👨🏻‍💻 🏄🏻‍♂️ 🎸 🇳🇱

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience, currently transitioning into Web3 to build Smart Contracts and Backend services in the crypto space.

Here you can see some of the latest Solidity projects I've been working on as well as previous Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, and NodeJs projects.

I'm currently working on improving my open source contributions, building in hackathons, and experimenting with new crypto technologies.

If you're building something in Web3 or looking to collaborate, feel free to reach out! [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/egpintos).
