### Hola! I'm Esteban 👋 👨🏻‍💻 🏄🏻‍♂️ 🎸 🇳🇱

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience, currently transitioning into Web3 to build Smart Contracts and Backend services in the crypto space.

Here you can see some of the latest Solidity projects I've been working on as well as previous Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, and NodeJs projects.

I'm currently focused on improving my open source contributions, building projects in hackathons, and exploring new crypto technologies. Check out my latest [Hackathon project](https://github.com/epintos/oasis-moncraft-game), where we won 🥉 in the [Oasis](https://oasis.net/) track.
